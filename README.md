Got started with OPENCV.
Learnt the basics of what OPENCV is, what it does and how to wwork with it.
Learnt working with images, videos as well as my own webcamera.
Understood colourpaces, shapes, contours, thresholding, blurring , resizing and other such fun manipulations which can be done on data.
